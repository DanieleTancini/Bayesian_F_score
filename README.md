# Bayesian_F_score

This repository contains the R functions and the replicability file used for the paper "A Bayesian approach to the F-score" by

D. Tancini (University of Perugia, IT); F. Bartolucci (University of Perugia, IT); S. Pandolfi (University of Perugia, IT).

Replicability folder: Replicability for simulation study

----------------------------

This folder contains:

Symulation1.R, the R file for the replicability of the first synthetic dataset. In the first block is considered the Bayesian logistic model and its frequentist version. In the second block is considered the Bayesian HMM, including the multimodel framework and the model averaging.

Symulation2.R, the R file for the replicability of the second synthetic dataset. In the first block is considered the Bayesian logistic model. In the second block is considered the Bayesian HMM and the frequentist logistic model, including for the first the multimodel framework and the model averaging.
